An automous car like Tesla.


Behavior-driven development [BDD] approach
As a "driver" I WANT the car to determine the speed limit and set the speed to that limit. SO THAT I don't have to adjust the speed myself.

Acceptance test-driven development [ATDD] approach GIVEN the speed limit 70km/h WHEN the car in moving THEN the speed limit should remain/adjusted between 65 and 70km/h

GIVEN the speed limit 70km/h WHEN the speed limit changes to 50km/h THEN deceleration rate should be 15km/h
